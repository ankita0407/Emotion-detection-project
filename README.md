üìå Overview
This project implements an Emotion Detection System using Python, which analyzes text or facial expressions (depending on dataset/approach) to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, fear, and neutral.
The system leverages machine learning / deep learning models to process input data and classify emotions accurately.

üöÄ Features
Detects emotions from text input or facial images

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computer Vision (depending on dataset)

Preprocessing techniques: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, image resizing, normalization

Trained on labeled datasets for emotion recognition

Achieves high accuracy through ML/DL models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN, LSTM)

User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI using Tkinter/Streamlit/Flask)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (for training results and metrics)
